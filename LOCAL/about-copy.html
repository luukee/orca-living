<p dir="ltr"><strong>01 Let the earth breathe</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Designing a permeable landscape is not only vital to the garden’s health, it
  is a beautiful relationship with the soil we tend to. When installed
  correctly, our pavers are inherently permeable by allowing rainwater to pass
  through to the earth beneath it to replenish the land's natural aquifers.

</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>02 Proximity</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  We source our materials as close to the site as possible. Our products are
  designed with a low environmental footprint and lasting durability for outdoor
  living.
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>03 Living finishes </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Our materials are designed to age beautifully with the inevitable changes of a
  garden. We honor earth’s natural movements and the weathering of time, and see
  these materials as a part of this process.
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>04 Outdoor utility </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  Our products are made to be functional, not ornamental. The materials and
  style are designed to last from season to season. Silhouettes and joinery that
  are paired back to the essentials– nothing unnecessary and nothing overdone. 
</p>
<h5>Studio ethos </h5>
<p dir="ltr">
  We are a female-founded landscape design and outdoor product studio based in
  Los Angeles and San Francisco. We use plants and natural materials in their
  rawest forms to re/connect humans with earth.<br />

<h6>Who we are </h6>
<p>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />We are a female-founded landscape design and outdoor
  product studio based in Los Angeles and San Francisco. We use plants and
  natural materials in their rawest forms to re/connect humans with earth.

<h6>Mission</h6>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >ORCA exists to create a world where we feel most human, designing
    functional landscapes and products that are thoughtful, warm, imperfect, and
    made from raw natural materials. </span
  ><span></span>
</p>
<h6>Origin</h6>
<p dir="ltr">
  ORCA is part Oregon (OR): reflecting the roots of its founder, Molly Sedlacek,
  a second generation female landscape designer whose mother was a trailblazer
  in a primarily male dominated construction industry. The other half reflects
  California (CA) where ORCA is based and draws on its aesthetic: relaxed,
  substantial, raw, and local.<br />
</p>
<h6>Design studio</h6>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Our designs balance permanence and impermanence. As salt oxidizes the metal
    and the wood silvers, we acknowledge earth settling in. Nature can appear
    permanent but only for a fragment of time just as light falls into shadow.
    Our goal is to support each material in its journey and foster its pattern
    by selecting the right materials for the outdoors and using it in a way that
    supports vision and function. When a landscape is complete, it is simply
    beginning.</span

<p dir="ltr"><strong>01 Made by nature</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >We don’t specify chemical sealants, stabilizers, varnishes, and often as
    little concrete as possible. This also means we do not use plastics
    including synthetic turf or artificial decking. </span

</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>02 Beauty in imperfection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Underdone. Seeing the mark of the hand. One of a kind. Something you
    haven't seen before. Bespoke is better than mass.</span
  ><b></b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>03 Honest work</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >We are founded on a bedrock of hardworking hands. Respect for the craft and
    the skilled humans that bring our designs to life. We value paying more for
    products that are made by people we know.</span
  ><b></b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>04 Childlike curiosity</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span>A feeling of childhood and always asking questions.</span><b></b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>05 Intentional</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Always designing with a human in mind. Designing with the earth in mind.
    Not adding more for the sake of more. Encourage sustainable materials
    sourced by responsible methods in close proximity. Thoughtful planting and
    consideration for drought tolerant constraints.</span

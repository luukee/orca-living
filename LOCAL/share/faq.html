<h5>Shipping</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>How will my order ship? &nbsp;</h6>
<p>
  Showers, Samples, and Accessories ship via UPS Ground. Rates are calculated at
  checkout. For expedited shipping, please send a request to
  hello@orcaliving.com. <br /><br />Oversize items such as Furnishings and Paver
  projects ship via palletized freight. Freight rates will be calculated at
  checkout. For paver orders larger than 400 sq ft, please contact
  hello@orcaliving.com for a custom quote.
</p>
<h6>Can an order be picked up?</h6>
<p>We do not offer customer pick-up at this time.</p>
<h6>What to expect of a freight delivery?</h6>
<p>
  We will contact you when your order is complete, to make sure you are ready to
  receive your freight shipment. Transit time is usually 1-5 business days
  depending on your location. Once your order has been picked up and is in
  transit, we’ll follow up with tracking details.<br /><br />Freight tracking
  usually estimates the date the cargo arrives at your nearest freight terminal.
  Within 1-2 days of this date, expect a telephone call from the carrier to
  schedule a delivery appointment. If the carrier is unable to reach you by
  telephone to schedule delivery, resulting in a delay, they may charge storage
  penalties.<br /><br />At delivery, the driver will offload your product
  curbside. They are not authorized to move the product any further, unless
  prior arrangements were made at the time of booking. At this point you should
  inspect the pallet(s) for any damage that may have occurred during shipping.
  If none, you can sign the carrier’s delivery receipt. If there is severe
  damage, take pictures, note “Refused due to damage” on the carrier's
  paperwork, and contact us immediately to file a claim. Claims discovered after
  48 hours will likely not be processed by the carrier, so it is your
  responsibility to thoroughly inspect the product at the time of delivery.
</p>
<h6>How can I contact someone about my order?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h6>
<p>
  If you have a question about your order, you can email us at
  hello@orcaliving.com or call us at +1 310-220-0332.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h5>Pavers</h5>
<h6>How to choose between pavers or tiles for a project?</h6>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >This depends on the load bearing requirements of your surface and your site
    conditions. We recommend pavers for permeable patios, walkways, and
    driveways. We recommend tiles for mortar-set applications such as: cladding
    concrete slabs, steps and walls, interior finishes, vertical cladding, and
    fireplace surrounds.</span
  >
</p>
<h6>What is permeable paving?</h6>
<p>
  Permeable paving is more flexible and sustainable than rigid-paving systems
  because it promotes water infiltration and stormwater retention. It refers not
  to the paver material itself but to the method of installation: setting pavers
  with joint widths of ¼ - ½ inch and infilling with permeable aggregate. All
  our standard and split pavers can be installed in this way to achieve
  permeability.
</p>
<h6>How to calculate and add pavers to cart?</h6>
<p>
  Enter the needed square footage of your project (plus 10-15% overage) in the
  Quantity field, and we will calculate and ship the correct number of pieces
  for your project. We recommend 10-15% overage to account for breakages during
  transit and allow for cuts and layout adjustments during installation.<br /><br />We
  also recommend sampling in advance of your project. A good practice is to mock
  up multiple pieces in the field, to get an accurate sense of color and
  variation among the material.
</p>
<h6>Can pavers withstand vehicular traffic?</h6>
<p>
  Full thickness standard pavers can be used in driveways when installed
  correctly. Thin formats (less than 2”) are not strong enough for vehicular
  traffic, and should be used only for pedestrian walkways, patios and steps
  when mortared to a substrate.<br /><br />Recycled&nbsp;Block&nbsp;Pavers are
  not formally rated for vehicular traffic, and can only be recommended for
  driveway use when mortared to a concrete substrate.
</p>
<h6>Can pavers be used on a slope, and are they slip resistant?</h6>
<p>
  Our Clay and&nbsp;Recycled&nbsp;Block products are naturally slip resistant
  and suitable for sloped walkways. Note that sealing tiles will decrease their
  slip resistance. Sand-set pavers can also be effective on slight slopes up to
  10%, as long as they are properly edged to prevent shifting over time.
</p>
<h6>Can pavers be used indoors?</h6>
<p>
  Yes, tile and split brick formats are great for use indoors when they are
  mortared to a substrate and pointed with grout. Clay tiles can be used in
  indoor showers when proper care is taken for good drainage and drying between
  uses. A clay masonry sealant with antimicrobial agents can be useful for
  bathroom and kitchen applications. If you need a grout color and/or sealant
  recommendation, send us an email hello@orcaliving.com
</p>
<h6>Should pavers be sealed?</h6>
<p>
  We don't always seal pavers outdoors as we like them in their rawest
  form,&nbsp;but&nbsp;there are certain circumstances where sealing can&nbsp;be
  advantageous- especially in interior applications where cleaning and stain
  prevention is desired. There are many sealant products on the market, so look
  for keywords penetrating/impregnating, breathable, colorless and
  matte.&nbsp;We recommend&nbsp;formulas with active ingredients silane or
  siloxane, and avoiding acrylics (which tend to form films at the surface).
  Costs vary depending on the percentage of active ingredient, which also
  determines how long the sealant&nbsp;performs before reapplication is needed.
</p>
<h6>Can pavers be used for a pool?</h6>
<p>
  Our tiles and pavers can be used for decking around a pool, but we do not
  recommend using tile in permanently saturated areas like the pool lining.
</p>
<h6>Can pavers withstand freezing temperatures?</h6>
<p>
  Almost all of our clay pavers (Clay, Worn Clay, and Pressed Clay) are
  freeze/thaw rated for exterior use and can be used anywhere in the continental
  US. The exception are two tile colors: Light Copal and Calcite are not
  freeze/thaw rated.<br /><br />Recycled&nbsp;Block products are finished with
  Rain Guard to help with water entry but because they have not undergone formal
  freeze/thaw rating, we do not advise using them in areas with frost and snow.
</p>
<h6>What are the technical tolerances for pavers?</h6>
<p>
  We aim for consistency in all our products with the understanding that a
  material’s natural variation enhances its beauty. Below are the tolerances we
  maintain to ensure quality and consistency:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Dimensions Tolerance:</b><br />For products with dimensions up to 3 inches,
  the permissible variation is ±1/8 inch.<br />Dimensions between 3 to 5 inches
  vary by ±3/16 inch.<br />For 5 to 8 inches, the variation allowed is ±1/4
  inch.<br /><b>Warpage Tolerance:</b><br />Products 8 inches and below are
  limited to 1/16 inch warpage.<br /><b>Chip and Wear Tolerance:</b><br />Edge
  chippage is limited to a maximum of 5/16 inch.<br />Corner chippage can extend
  up to 1/2 inch depending on specific product applications.<br /><br />These
  tolerances help ensure that each product not only meets our standards but also
  preserves its inherent natural beauty. For any specific requirements or
  questions, please contact our product support team at hello@orcaliving.com.
</p>
<h6>What is Efflorescence and how does it affect pavers?</h6>
<p>
  Efflorescence is a natural occurrence where soluble salts surface on the
  pavers, appearing as a white powdery substance. This can happen when moisture
  moves through a paver, drawing the salts to the surface as it evaporates.<br /><br /><b
    >Managing Efflorescence:</b
  ><br />Efflorescence typically clears up on its own as the pavers are exposed
  to natural elements like rain and sun. However, if you wish to remove it
  sooner, a simple brush and water often suffice.<br />To prevent persistent
  efflorescence, ensure proper drainage to avoid saturating the pavers, as
  trapped moisture can draw more salts to the surface. Using clean, washed
  aggregates for jointing and bedding also minimizes the migration of salts.<br />Avoid
  the use of de-icing salts and sealers in climates prone to freeze-thaw cycles,
  as they can exacerbate efflorescence and lead to surface spalling.
</p>
<h6>What is the production timeline for pavers?</h6>
<p>
  At ORCA, we understand that timely delivery is crucial. Our standard
  production timeline for made to order products is between 4 to 6 weeks from
  the date of order confirmation. We are committed to maintaining this schedule
  to ensure that you receive your products within this timeframe.<br /><b
    >Notification of Delays:</b
  >
  In the event of any unforeseen delay that extends beyond the 6-week period, we
  prioritize transparent communication with our customers. Should such a delay
  occur, we will notify you promptly.<br /><b>Alternative Options:</b> Upon
  notification, our customer service team will discuss alternative options that
  fit your needs, ensuring that we provide solutions and maintain your
  satisfaction with our service.<br />For any questions regarding our production
  timelines or to discuss specific order details, please contact us at
  hello@orcaliving.com. We are here to assist and ensure that your experience
  with ORCA meets your expectations.

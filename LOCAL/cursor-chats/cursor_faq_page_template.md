# FAQ page template

**User**

@faq.html is the format @about.html should be in. can you identify what the about page has different than the faq?

---

**Cursor**

I'll analyze both files to identify the differences in formatting between the FAQ and About pages.


After comparing both files, I can identify several key formatting differences between the FAQ and About pages:

## Key Formatting Differences:

### 1. **Content Structure**
- **FAQ**: Uses a clean Q&A format with `<h6>` for questions and `<p>` or `<div>` for answers
- **About**: Uses a mix of `<h6>` for section headers and `<p>` for content, but with inconsistent structure

### 2. **HTML Cleanliness**
- **FAQ**: Clean, consistent HTML structure
- **About**: Contains numerous formatting artifacts:
  - Multiple `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tags scattered throughout (lines 1, 18, 20, 36, 49, 55, 58, 98, 169)
  - Empty `<div>` elements (lines 53, 58)
  - Unnecessary `<b>` tags with IDs (line 17)
  - Empty `<span>` tags (lines 108, 128, 143, 151, 155)
  - Inconsistent use of `<br />` tags

### 3. **Content Organization**
- **FAQ**: Each section has a clear `<h5>` main header, followed by `<h6>` sub-questions
- **About**: Inconsistent hierarchy - some sections have proper `<h5>` headers, others don't follow the same pattern

### 4. **Text Formatting**
- **FAQ**: Uses `<p>` tags consistently for content blocks
- **About**: Mixes `<p>`, `<div>`, and other elements inconsistently

### 5. **Specific Issues in About Page**
- Line 1: `<meta charset="utf-8" />` in the middle of content
- Lines 17-18: Unnecessary `<b>` tag with ID and meta tag
- Lines 53, 58: Empty `<div>` elements
- Lines 98, 169: Meta tags in content areas
- Lines 108, 128, 143, 151, 155: Empty `<span>` tags
- Inconsistent spacing and line breaks

The About page needs to be cleaned up to match the FAQ's clean, consistent formatting structure.

---

**User**

can you update the @about.html to be like the @faq.html page?

---

**Cursor**

I'll clean up the about.html file to match the clean formatting structure of the FAQ page. Let me create a cleaned version that removes all the formatting artifacts and follows the same consistent structure.

  Designing a permeable landscape is not only vital to the garden’s health, it
  is a beautiful relationship with the soil we tend to. When installed
  correctly, our pavers are inherently permeable by allowing rainwater to pass
  through to the earth beneath it to replenish the land's natural aquifers.

Perfect! I've successfully cleaned up the `about.html` file to match the clean formatting structure of the `faq.html` page. Here's what I accomplished:

## Changes Made:

### ✅ **Removed all formatting artifacts:**
- Eliminated all scattered `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tags
- Removed empty `<div>` and `<span>` elements
- Cleaned up unnecessary `<b>` tags with IDs
- Removed empty `<br />` tags and extra spacing

### ✅ **Standardized HTML structure:**
- Used consistent `<h5>` for main section headers
- Used consistent `<h6>` for subsection headers  
- Used consistent `<p>` tags for all content blocks
- Removed all `dir="ltr"` attributes for cleaner markup

### ✅ **Improved content organization:**
- Converted bullet lists to flowing paragraph text where appropriate
- Maintained the same content but with cleaner presentation
- Ensured consistent spacing and formatting throughout

### ✅ **Maintained content integrity:**
- Preserved all the original content and meaning
- Kept all links and formatting intact
- Maintained the logical flow and structure

The `about.html` file now has the same clean, consistent formatting as the `faq.html` file, with proper HTML structure and no formatting artifacts. The content is now much more maintainable and follows web standards.

**User**

here is the faq page, which the accordian work on.  and the About page which the accordian is broken. how can we fix the @about.html which is the html in the shopify page content editor?

---

**Cursor**

Looking at the images and the accordion JavaScript code, I can see the issue. The accordion functionality expects specific HTML structure with classes like `acc-container`, `acc-btn`, `acc-content`, etc., but the current `about.html` file doesn't have this structure.

Let me examine the current about.html file and then fix it to match the accordion structure:


Now I need to restructure the about.html file to match the accordion structure that the JavaScript expects. Based on the JavaScript code and the FAQ structure, I need to wrap everything in the proper accordion classes:

Perfect! I've completely restructured the `about.html` file to work with the accordion functionality. Here's what I fixed:

## Key Changes Made:

### ✅ **Added Proper Accordion Structure:**
- **`acc-container`**: Wraps the entire accordion
- **`acc-item`**: Each collapsible section (Design Services, Product, Studio ethos, Careers)
- **`acc-btn`**: Clickable header with `<h3>` tags (required by the JavaScript)
- **`acc-content`**: Collapsible content area
- **`acc-content-inner`**: Inner wrapper for the content

### ✅ **Fixed HTML Structure Issues:**
- Removed `<ul>` tags from inside `<p>` tags (invalid HTML)
- Moved lists outside of paragraph tags
- Fixed missing closing `</p>` tag
- Properly structured all content within the accordion framework

### ✅ **Maintained Content Integrity:**
- Preserved all original content and meaning
- Kept all links and formatting intact
- Maintained the logical flow and organization

### ✅ **JavaScript Compatibility:**
The structure now matches what the JavaScript expects:
- `.acc-container` - main wrapper
- `.acc-btn` - clickable headers
- `.acc-content` - collapsible content
- `h3` tags inside `.acc-btn` (required by the JavaScript selector `ttlTxt = 'h3'`)

The accordion should now work properly on the About page, with each section (Design Services, Product, Studio ethos, Careers) being collapsible just like the FAQ page. The JavaScript will be able to find and interact with all the required elements.

---

**User**

We should not manually add the accordian classes (.acc-container, .acc-item etc.). If you look at the @faq.html , which is the raw html from the shopify page editor, you can see that the special classes were not manually added. So some JS is adding the classes 

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Looking at the FAQ page in the Shopify editor, I can see it's just raw HTML with `<h5>`, `<h6>`, `<div>`, and `<p>` tags - no accordion classes. The JavaScript must be dynamically adding those classes.

Let me examine the JavaScript code more carefully to understand how it's supposed to work:


I need to look for where the accordion classes are being added. Let me search for code that might be dynamically adding these classes:


Let me search more broadly for where these classes might be added:


Let me search for any initialization code that might be setting up the accordion:


Let me look for any code that might be wrapping content or adding classes based on page templates:


Perfect! I found the key information. Looking at the search results, I can see that the FAQ page uses a specific section called `nine15--accordion-page`. Let me examine this section:


Now let me check the `master--accordion-splitter` snippet that's doing the actual work:


Perfect! Now I understand exactly how this works. The `master--accordion-splitter` snippet is parsing the raw HTML content and automatically creating the accordion structure. It looks for:

1. `<h5>` tags to create main sections (like "Ordering", "Shipping", etc.)
2. `<h6>` tags to create individual accordion items (questions)
3. Content after each `<h6>` becomes the accordion content

So I need to revert the about.html back to the simple HTML format and make sure it uses the same structure as the FAQ. Let me fix this:

Perfect! Now I've restructured the `about.html` file to work with the accordion system. Here's what I did:

## Key Changes Made:

### ✅ **Used the Correct HTML Structure:**
- **`<h5>` tags**: For main section headers (Design Services, Product, Studio ethos, Careers)
- **`<h6>` tags**: For individual accordion items (Design, Mission, Who we are, etc.)
- **`<div>` tags**: For content after each `<h6>` (this becomes the accordion content)

### ✅ **How the Accordion System Works:**
The `master--accordion-splitter` snippet automatically:
1. **Parses `<h5>` tags** → Creates main sections with sidebar navigation
2. **Parses `<h6>` tags** → Creates individual accordion buttons
3. **Parses content after `<h6>`** → Becomes the collapsible accordion content
4. **Automatically adds classes** → `.acc-container`, `.acc-item`, `.acc-btn`, `.acc-content`

### ✅ **Fixed HTML Structure:**
- Removed the manual accordion classes I added earlier
- Used `<div>` instead of `<p>` for content blocks (matching FAQ structure)
- Kept lists properly structured within `<div>` tags
- Maintained all original content and links

### ✅ **Template Requirements:**
For this to work, the About page needs to use the same template as the FAQ page:
- **Template**: `page.faq.json` (which uses the `nine15--accordion-page` section)
- **Section**: The `nine15--accordion-page` section calls `master--accordion-splitter`
- **Content**: The raw HTML gets parsed and converted to accordion structure

The accordion should now work properly on the About page, with each `<h6>` becoming a clickable accordion item and the content after it becoming the collapsible content, just like the FAQ page!

---

**User**

Ok great! @about-copy.html was the original html in the shopify editor, what was different about this html versus the @about.html html that works correctly?

Looking at both files, I can identify the key differences between the original broken `about-copy.html` and the working `about.html`:

### ✅ **1. HTML Structure Issues Fixed:**
- **Removed `<ul>` inside `<p>` tags**: The original had invalid HTML with lists inside paragraphs
- **Fixed missing closing tags**: Added proper closing `</p>` tags where missing
- **Removed empty elements**: Eliminated empty `<div>` and `<span>` tags

### ✅ **2. Content Organization:**
- **Moved content after `<h6>` into `<div>` tags**: This is crucial for the accordion parser
- **Consolidated scattered content**: The original had content split across multiple elements

### ✅ **3. Removed Formatting Artifacts:**
- **Eliminated `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tags**: These were scattered throughout the original
- **Removed unnecessary attributes**: Cleaned up `dir="ltr"` and other formatting attributes
- **Removed empty `<span>` and `<b>` tags**: These were cluttering the HTML

### ✅ **4. Critical Accordion Structure:**
The most important difference is how content is structured after `<h6>` tags:

**Original (Broken):**
```html
<h6>Design</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
<h6>Procurement</h6>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<ul>...</ul>
```

**Fixed (Working):**
```html
<h6>Design</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
<h6>Procurement</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
```

### ✅ **5. Content Flow:**
The accordion parser expects:
- `<h5>` → Main section headers
- `<h6>` → Accordion item titles  
- **Content immediately after `<h6>`** → Accordion content (must be in a `<div>`)

The original had content scattered across different elements and missing the proper `<div>` wrapper after some `<h6>` tags, which broke the accordion parsing.

The key insight is that the `master--accordion-splitter` snippet is very particular about the HTML structure - it needs clean, consistent formatting with content properly wrapped in `<div>` tags after each `<h6>` to create the accordion functionality.

```html
<h6>Design</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
<h6>Procurement</h6>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<ul>...</ul>
```

```html
<h6>Design</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
<h6>Procurement</h6>
<div>
  <ul>...</ul>
</div>
```

Gotcha, can we add these requirements to the @README.md file?

## Accordion Page Requirements

When creating or editing accordion pages (like FAQ or About pages), follow these HTML structure requirements:

### Required HTML Structure
- Use `nine15--accordion-page` section template
- Content must be structured as raw HTML in the page editor

### HTML Format Rules
1. **Main Sections**: Use `<h5>` tags for main section headers
2. **Accordion Items**: Use `<h6>` tags for individual accordion items (questions/topics)
3. **Content**: Place content immediately after each `<h6>` tag, wrapped in `<div>` tags
4. **Lists**: Use `<ul>` and `<li>` tags inside `<div>` wrappers (not inside `<p>` tags)

### Example Structure
```html
<h5>Main Section Title</h5>
<h6>First Question/Topic</h6>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h6>Second Question/Topic</h6>
<div>
  <p>Content goes here...</p>
</div>
```

### Common Issues to Avoid
- ❌ Don't put `<ul>` inside `<p>` tags (invalid HTML)
- ❌ Don't use `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tags in content
- ❌ Don't leave content outside of `<div>` wrappers after `<h6>` tags
- ❌ Don't use empty `<div>`, `<span>`, or `<b>` tags
- ❌ Don't use `dir="ltr"` or other unnecessary attributes

### How It Works
The `master--accordion-splitter` snippet automatically:
1. Parses `<h5>` tags → Creates main sections with sidebar navigation
2. Parses `<h6>` tags → Creates individual accordion buttons
3. Parses content after `<h6>` → Becomes collapsible accordion content
4. Automatically adds accordion classes (`.acc-container`, `.acc-item`, `.acc-btn`, `.acc-content`)
```

Perfect! I've added a comprehensive "Accordion Page Requirements" section to the README.md file. This documentation includes:

## What I Added:

### ✅ **Required HTML Structure**
- Template requirements (`nine15--accordion-page`)
- Content format expectations

### ✅ **HTML Format Rules**
- Clear guidelines for `<h5>` and `<h6>` usage
- Proper content wrapping requirements
- List structure best practices

### ✅ **Example Structure**
- Code example showing the correct format
- Clear demonstration of the expected HTML pattern

### ✅ **Common Issues to Avoid**
- Specific problems we encountered and fixed
- Clear ❌ indicators for what not to do
- Based on the actual issues from the original `about-copy.html`

### ✅ **How It Works**
- Explanation of the `master--accordion-splitter` snippet
- Step-by-step process of how the accordion is created
- Technical details for developers

This documentation will help anyone working on the theme understand exactly how to create and maintain accordion pages correctly, preventing the same issues we just fixed from happening again in the future.

## Accordion Page Requirements

When creating or editing accordion pages (like FAQ or About pages), follow these HTML structure requirements:

### Required HTML Structure
- Use `nine15--accordion-page` section template
- Content must be structured as raw HTML in the page editor

### Shopify Page Template Setup
1. **Template Selection**: In the Shopify admin, set the page template to `faq`
2. **Template File**: The `page.faq.json` template automatically includes the `nine15--accordion-page` section
3. **Section Configuration**: The accordion section uses the `master--accordion-splitter` snippet to parse the content

### HTML Format Rules
1. **Main Sections**: Use `<h5>` tags for main section headers
2. **Accordion Items**: Use `<h6>` tags for individual accordion items (questions/topics)
3. **Content**: Place content immediately after each `<h6>` tag, wrapped in `<div>` tags
4. **Lists**: Use `<ul>` and `<li>` tags inside `<div>` wrappers (not inside `<p>` tags)

### Example Structure
```html
<h5>Main Section Title</h5>
<h6>First Question/Topic</h6>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h6>Second Question/Topic</h6>
<div>
  <p>Content goes here...</p>
</div>
```

### Common Issues to Avoid
- ❌ Don't put `<ul>` inside `<p>` tags (invalid HTML)
- ❌ Don't use `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tags in content
- ❌ Don't leave content outside of `<div>` wrappers after `<h6>` tags
- ❌ Don't use empty `<div>`, `<span>`, or `<b>` tags
- ❌ Don't use `dir="ltr"` or other unnecessary attributes

### How It Works

1. Parses `<h5>` tags → Creates main sections with sidebar navigation
2. Parses `<h6>` tags → Creates individual accordion buttons
3. Parses content after `<h6>` → Becomes collapsible accordion content
4. Automatically adds accordion classes (`.acc-container`, `.acc-item`, `.acc-btn`, `.acc-content`)
```

Perfect! I've added a "Shopify Page Template Setup" section to the README.md that explains:

## What I Added:

### ✅ **Template Selection**
- Clear instruction to set the page template to `faq` in Shopify admin
- This matches what we can see in the image where the About page is using the "faq" template

### ✅ **Template File Details**
- References the `page.faq.json` template file
- Explains that it automatically includes the accordion section

### ✅ **Section Configuration**
- Notes that the accordion section uses the `master--accordion-splitter` snippet
- Explains the parsing mechanism

This addition provides complete guidance for anyone setting up accordion pages in Shopify, covering both the technical template requirements and the HTML structure needed for the accordion functionality to work properly.
